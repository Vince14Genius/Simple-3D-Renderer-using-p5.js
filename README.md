# Simple-3D-Renderer-using-p5.js
A simple 3D renderer, created using the library p5.js, only supports rotation along the y-axis (movement is allowed on all axes); it is done by translating points from 3D space to a 2D screen using simple vector &amp; trig operations, and this project is used for my Math IA.
