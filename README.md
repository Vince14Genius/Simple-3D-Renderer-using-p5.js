# Simple-3D-Renderer-using-p5.js

A simple 3D renderer, created using the 2D graphics library p5.js. It only supports rotation along the y-axis (movement is allowed on all axes), and works by translating points from 3D space to a 2D screen using simple vector & trig operations. 

This project is created for my Math IA, an assignment for the higher level mathematics course in the International Baccalaureate program.
