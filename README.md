# Simple-3D-Renderer-using-p5.js
A simple 3D renderer, created using the library p5.js, only supports rotation along the y-axis (movement is allowed on all axes); it is done by translating points from 3D space to a 2D screen using simple vector &amp; trig operations, and this project is used for my Math IA. 

## Instructions & Controls
Open index.html with any browser that is compatible with the p5.js library to run. 
Movement: WASD or arrow keys (x and z axes), Space (y-upward), and Shift (y-downward)
Y-Rotation: position of mouse cursor
